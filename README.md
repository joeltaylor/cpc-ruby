# CPC-Ruby

The purpose of this gem is to define, in Ruby, what I have learned to do by way of programming.

The `lib` folder contains a collection of Ruby files.  
The `spec` folder contains a collection of Spec files.

## lib Folder
- `cpc.rb`
- `cpc/`
  - `classifier.rb`
  - `data_parser.rb`
  - `version.rb`



- Each Ruby file contains a single **Module**.
- Each **Module** contains at least one **method**.
- Each **method** is an abstraction of an operation that has proven useful to me.

## spec Folder
- Each Ruby file has a corresponding **Spec** file.
- In order to run the test in RSpec, I need to include the Module in the Spec file.

## Where I need help
I want to construct a Class
