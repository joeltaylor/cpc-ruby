Feature: Five Number Summary
  I want to calculate the following values for five numbers:
  Minimum, First Quartile (Q1), Median (Second Quartile; Q2), Third Quartile (Q3), Maximum

  Scenario Outline:
    Given I input five numbers "<input_numbers>"
    Then I should calculate a five number summary "<output_numbers>"

    Examples:
    | input_numbers                  | output_numbers          |
    | 5,4,6,-8,-2,-1,-8,7            | -8.0,-5.0,1.5,5.5,7.0   |
    | 4,6,-6,7,-3                    | -6,-3,4,6,7             |
    | 7,15,36,39,40,41               | 7.0,15.0,37.5,40.0,41.0 |
    | 6,7,15,36,39,40,41,42,43,47,49 | 6.0,25.5,40.0,42.5,49.0 |
    | 1,2,3,4,5                      | 1,2,3,4,5               |
    | 1,2,3,4,5,6                    | 1.0,2.0,3.5,5.0,6.0     |
    | 6,7,15,36,39,40,41,42,43,47,49 | 6.0,25.5,40.0,42.5,49.0 |
